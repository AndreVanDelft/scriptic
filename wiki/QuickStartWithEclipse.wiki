= Introduction =

If you have the development environment Eclipse installed (available from http://Eclipse.org, the following steps may get you started quickly.

= Steps =

Download the Scriptic All-in-1 zip archive from http://code.google.com/p/scriptic/downloads/detail?name=scriptic-all-in-one.zip

Unpack the zip archive in your Eclipse `workspace\` folder, yielding there a folder hierarchy
{{{
  scriptic/
    dimensions
    doc
    Examples
    lib
}}}

Tell the Eclipse text editor that Scriptic source files are like Java source files, etc:
 * In Eclipse, issue the menu command `Window|Preferences`, which makes the Preferences dialog appear
 * Select `General|Workspace`, and switch on the check box `Refresh automatically`
 * Select `General|Editors|File Associations`.
 * In the `File Associations` panel, click the link `Content Types`.
 * In the `Content Types` panel, open the map `Text`; click `Java Source File`.
 * Add file association for file type `*.sawa`.

In Eclipse, issue the menu command `File|New|Project` to create a new development project using a wizard.
 * in the first wizard page, select `Java project`, and go to the next page
 * in the second wizard page, name the new project, for instance `Scriptic Demo`, and go to the next page
 * in the third page, `Java Settings`:
   * in tab `Source`, select the displayed folder `src`
     * click the link `Configure inclusion and exclusion filters`
     * in the `Inclusion and Exclusion Patterns` dialog, enter _*exclusion*_ pattern `*.sawa`, and click `Finish` to close the dialog
   * in tab `Libraries`, click button `Add External JARs...`
     * using the `JAR Selection` dialog, add from folder `..../workspace/scriptic/lib` the files `sawa.jar` and `scripticvm.jar` 

Using the file manager outside Exclipse, copy the folder `Examples` from `..../workspace/scriptic/` into folder `..../workspace/Scriptic Demo/src`

Create a Run Configuration for the Scriptic compiler:
 * In Eclipse, issue the menu command `Run|Open Run Dialog` to open the dialog named `Create, manage, and run configurations`
 * Double click `Java Application`; this creates a new configuration
 * Change the name into `Compile Scriptic sources`
 *
